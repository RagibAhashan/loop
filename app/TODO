# TODOs

1. Stop doing too much work on UI/React side and move logic to backend, i.e :

-   Assigning proxies to task, no need to track

General note : The UI state does not need to store and manage information that is related to business logic,
for example, at the moment we are storing proxies and doing proxies assignement logic in the redux state. This slows the app, we would rather
assign proxies in a structure that is stored in the backend only, and if we want to check what proxy a task is using we could just fetch it from the backend.
